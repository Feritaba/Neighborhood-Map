# React Neighborhood Map
### Front End Web Developer Nanodegree

> I developed a single-page application using React featuring a map of my neighborhood. I added additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or places Iâ€™d like to have coffee at, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a list view to support simple browsing of all locations.
